I"•<p>â€œFrom Inc.comâ€™s most popular columnist, a counterintuitiveâ€“but highly practicalâ€“guide to finding and maintaining the motivation to achieve great things.â€ With a blurb like that, this book by Jeff Haden seemed very intriguing. However, there are several books where the blurbs are really exciting. Also, I hadnâ€™t heard of the author. I wasnâ€™t sure whether this book would be any good.</p>
